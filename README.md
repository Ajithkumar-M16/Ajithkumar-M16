### Hey Soldier ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ajithkumar...
I'm a Computer Science & Engineering graduate who is learning and improving myself every day to become a purpose-driven individual in my career and life. This GitHub is my ticket. The projects that I've uploaded here are the outcome of numerous hours of hard work over several months. I proudly say, "I'm a good self-learner"; all the skills that I have learned and implemented as projects are by myself. I will continue to do this every day for the rest of my life. I can already feel the impact. Definitely it will be radiated where the ship anchored. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects to improve my data analytical skills.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data engineering tools as well.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to shake hand with those who keeps on pushing and upgrading themselves.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I read David Goggin's Can't Hurt Me book recently. So...
